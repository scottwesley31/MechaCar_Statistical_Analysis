### Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Multiple linear regression was performed on the MechaCar fuel efficiency dataset. Here is a screenshot of the results:

#### What variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
1) Intercept ***
2) vehicle_length ***
3) ground_clearance ***

#### Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?
The p-values of the coefficients listed above are all less than an assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates that the slope of this linear model is not zero (because there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis of a non-zero slope).

#### Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
